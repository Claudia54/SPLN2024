# TPC1
It was developed a script that analyzes text from a book and outputs the frequency of each word. Two flags were added such as a feature with the "-m" option, which, when used as "-m x" (with x being an integer), returns only the top x most frequent words.
It was also added a flag such as an  "-n" option to display the words in alphabetical order rather than by frequency.
